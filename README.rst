Critique of "The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels" by Alex Epstein
=============================================================

I tried to read this book when it was recommended by a friend. Reviews on Amazon 
were glowing and so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was unable to get 
beyond the first chapter. Rather than being informative, I found it to be 
uncritical promotion of fossil fuels.

I will not go into any depth as to my issues with this book, I will say one 
thing. The basic premise is that humanity has tremendously benefited from cheap 
energy from fossil fuels. I have no argument with that as it is obviously true.  
But the benefit came from the availability of cheap energy. The fact that it was 
fossil fuels that provided the benefits was largely incidental to the benefit.  
Had we achieved the cheap energy using solar, wind, or nuclear, the benefit 
would have been the same. However, there are down sides to fossil fuels; 
significant down sides. As such, it is important that we constantly examine our 
energy choices and move towards better alternatives with fewer down sides.  
I worry that this book will act to discourage the search for better 
alternatives.

There is however one more point I will make. After giving up on Chapter 
1 I skipped ahead to the chapter on global warming and ran into a section where 
the author clearly tries to mislead the reader.


Misleading Section on Greenhouse Effect
---------------------------------------

In chapter 4 the author claims that "the greenhouse effect of CO₂ is an *extreme 
diminishing effect*".  Here is the text:


    As the following illustration shows, the greenhouse effect of CO₂
    is an *extreme diminishing effect* — a *logarithmically* decreasing effect.
    This is how the function looks when measured in a laboratory.

    Notice that we are just before 400 ppm (which means CO₂ is 0.04 percent of 
    the atmosphere), where the effect really starts tapering off; the warming 
    effect of each new molecule is not much.

    This means that the initial parts per million of CO₂ do the vast majority of 
    the warming of our atmosphere.  The image below shows how, all things being 
    equal, the heating effect of each additional increment of CO₂ is smaller and 
    smaller.

As the source of this data Epstein cites the following:

    Figure 1: Radiative forcing as a function of concentration of CO₂.

As you can see, these two figures differ.


The model is given in Table 3. It is:

    ΔF = α ln(C/C₀)
    where
        α = 5.35 (or 6.3)
        C₀ = 280 (unstated, but can be extracted from the graph)

There is no evidence that this is a physical model. Indeed it has the look of 
a fitted model. This implies that it has no predictive value and should not be 
used outside of the measured range (300 — 1000 PPM).  In fact, it has 
a non-physical singularity at C = 0 where it predicts infinite cooling.

The Myhre presents this as an incremental model, ΔF is the change in the 
radiative forcing given the increase in CO₂ over pre-industrial levels.

Epstein extends the model outside its range to the point were it becomes 
singular (C = 0), ignores the singularity, and then draws conclusions not 
supported by the original ideas.
